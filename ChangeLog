	* test/integration/helper.rb: More stray debug output

2011-06-05  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* Rakefile, app/options.rb, app/run.rb, bin/trepan8,
	interface/script.rb, processor/command/set_subcmd/debug.rb,

	* trepan8.gemspec: Correct dependency version number for linecache

	* .gitignore, Rakefile, app/default.rb, app/options.rb,
	bin/trepan8, lib/debugger.rb, lib/trepanning.rb,
	test/unit/.gitignore, test/unit/test-app-options.rb,
	trepan8.gemspec: Port over Rakefile from rb-trepanning. Add first
	unit test (from rb-trepanning).

	* First attempt to backport trepanning. Right now it's mostly
	ruby-debug w/o ruby-debug-base and separated from the main code in
	git. There are some small changes towards the trepanning file system
	organization. Also module Debugger is now module Trepan.
